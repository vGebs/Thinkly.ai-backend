When we want to get back into our project, we have the do the following.

1. Go to the directory when the environment is installed
2. call this in terminal % source venv/bin/activate
3. To leave the environment we simply call % deactivate


Make sure the interpretter is being used: 

VS Code: If you are using Visual Studio Code, select the Python interpreter from your venv 
    by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner (or by using the command 
    palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P), and typing/selecting Python: Select Interpreter). Then choose 
    the interpreter inside your venv.


Issue: .env issues

1. Openai key cannot have ' or " 
2. The firestore key must be encoded then decoded in the app 

When running the container locally we need to use this command:

docker run --env-file ./.env -p 3000:3000 thinkly_backend

We need to specify the .env because docker does not have that file in the container.
